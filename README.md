# DATA ANALYSIS

Data Preparation and analysis: 

Cleaned raw data to remove inconsistencies using Excel. 
Used SQL to query and filter data for key attributes like Ride Volume, Revenue, and Cancellations. 
Ride Volume Over Time:Created a line chart to observe daily ride trends, identifying peak and low-demand days. 
Booking Status Breakdown:Developed a doughnut chart to show successful bookings, customer cancellations, and driver cancellations. 
Vehicle Type Insights:Used a bar chart to display the top 5 vehicle types by ride distance.Visualized average customer ratings for different vehicle types. 
Revenue Analysis:Designed a column chart to analyze revenue by payment method (Cash, UPI, Credit Card, Debit Card). 
Generated a table of the top 5 customers by booking value.Plotted a Chart of ride distance distribution per day. 
Cancellations Analysis:Created bar charts for reasons behind customer and driver cancellations. 
Ratings Analysis:Visualized driver ratings distribution. Compared customer and driver ratings.
